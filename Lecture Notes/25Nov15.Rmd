Agenda
===
- What databases are, and why
- SQL
- Interfacing R and SQL

Databases
===
- A **field** is like a column in a dataframe
- A **record** is a collection of observations in **fields**
- A **table** is a collection of records which all have the same fields (with possibly different values)
- A **database** is a collection of tables


Databases vs. Dataframes
===
- R's dataframes are actually tables

R jargon | Database jargon
--------|----------------
column  | field
row     | record
dataframe | table
types of the columns | table **schema**
bunch of related dataframes       | database


So, Why Do We Need Database Software?
===

- _Size_
    + R keeps its dataframes in memory
    + Industrial databases can be much bigger
    + Work with selected subsets
- _Speed_
    + Clever people have worked very hard on getting just what you want fast
- _Concurrency_
    + Many users accessing the same database simultaneously
    + Lots of potential for trouble (two users want to change the same record at once)
    
    
The Client-Server Model
===

- Databases live on a **server**, which manages them
- Users interact with the server through a **client** program
- Lets multiple users access the same database simultaneously





SQL
===
- A query allows you to look into certain parts of the dataset
- **SQL** (**structured query language**) is the standard for database software
- Mostly about **queries**, which are like doing a selection in R

```
debt[debt$Country=="France",c("growth","ratio")]
subset(x=debt,subset=(Country=="France"),select=c("growth","ratio"))
```
- Let's look at how SQL does stuff like this


SELECT
===

```
SELECT columns or computations
  FROM table
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY columns
  HAVING condition
  ORDER BY column [ASC|DESC]
  LIMIT offset,count;
```

- `SELECT` is the first word of a query, then modifiers say which fields/columns to use, and what conditions records/rows must meet, from which tables

- The final semi-colon is obligatory

SELECT
===
```
SELECT PlayerID,yearID,AB,H FROM Batting;
```
Four columns from table `Batting`

```
SELECT * FROM Salaries;
```
All columns from table `Salaries`

```
SELECT * FROM Salaries ORDER BY Salary;
```
As above, but by ascending value of `Salary`

```
SELECT * FROM Salaries ORDER BY Salary DESC;
```
Descending order

```
SELECT * FROM Salaries ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 10;
```
top 10 salaries

SELECT
===
Picking out rows meeting a condition
```
SELECT PlayerID,yearID,AB,H FROM Batting WHERE AB > 100 AND H > 0;
```
vs.
```
Batting[Batting$AB>100 & Batting$H > 0, c("PlayerID","yearID","AB","H")]
```

Calculated Columns
===
- SQL knows about some simple summary statistics:

```
SELECT MIN(AB), AVG(AB), MAX(AB) FROM Batting;
```

- It can do arithmetic

```
SELECT AB,H,H/CAST(AB AS REAL) FROM Batting;
```

Necessary because `AB` and `H` are integers, and it won't give you a fractional part by default

- Calculated columns can get names:

```
SELECT PlayerID,yearID,H/CAST(AB AS REAL) AS BattingAvg FROM Batting
  ORDER BY BattingAvg DESC LIMIT 10;
```


Aggregating
===
We can do calculations on value-grouped subsets, like in `aggregate` or `d*ply`
```
SELECT playerID, SUM(salary) FROM Salaries GROUP BY playerID
```

Selecting Again
===
- First cut of records is with `WHERE`
- Aggregation of recordw with `GROUP BY`
- Post-aggregation selection with `HAVING`

```
SELECT playerID, SUM(salary) AS totalSalary FROM Salaries GROUP BY playerID
  HAVING totalSalary > 200000000
```


JOIN
===

- So far `FROM` has just been one table
- Sometimes we need to combine information from many tables


`patient_last` | `patient_first` | `physician_id` | complaint
---------------|-----------------|---------------|----------
Morgan        | Dexter           | 37010        | insomnia
Soprano        | Anthony         | 79676         | malaise
 Swearengen    | Albert          | NA            | healthy as a goddam horse
Garrett       | Alma             | 90091       | nerves
Holmes        | Sherlock        | 43675         | nicotine-patch addiction

`physician_last`  | `physician_first` | `physicianID` | `plan`
------------------|-------------------|---------------|------
Meridian          | Emmett            |  37010        | UPMC
Melfi             | Jennifer          | 79676         | BCBS
Cochran           | Amos              | 90091         | UPMC
Watson            | John              | 43675         | VA


JOIN
===
- Suppose we want to know which doctors are treating patients for insomnia
   + Complaints are in one table
   + Physicians are in the other
- In R, we'd use `merge` to link the tables up by `physicianID`
- Here, `physician_id` or `physicianID` is acting as the **key** or **unique identifier**
- SQL doesn't have `merge`, it has `JOIN` as a modifier to `FROM`
    
Updated Translation Table
===

R jargon | Database jargon
--------|----------------
column  | field
row     | record
dataframe | table
types of the columns | table schema
bunch of dataframes       | database
selections, `subset` | `SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... HAVING`
`aggregate`, `d*ply` | `GROUP BY`
`merge`              | `JOIN`
`order`              | `ORDER BY`

Connecting R to SQL
===

- SQL is a language; database management systems (DMBS) actually implement it and do the work
    + MySQL, SQLite, etc., etc.
- They all have somewhat different conventions
- The R package `DBI` is a unified interface to them
- Need a separate "driver" for each DBMS


Connecting R to SQL
====

```
install.packages("DBI", dependencies = TRUE) # Install DBI
install.packages("RSQLite", dependencies = TRUE) # Install driver for SQLite
library(RSQLite)
drv <- dbDriver('SQLite')
con <- dbConnect(drv, dbname="baseball.db")
```

`con` is now a persistent connection to the database `baseball.db`

If you want to try it, `baseball.db` is on class website.

Connecting R to SQL
===

```
dbListTables(con)         # Get tables in the database (returns vector)
dbListFields(con, name)  # List fields in a table
dbReadTable(con, name)   # Import a table as a data frame
```

Connecting R to SQL
====

```
dbGetQuery(conn, statement)
df <- dbGetQuery(con, paste(
  "SELECT nameLast,nameFirst,yearID,salary",
  "FROM Master NATURAL JOIN Salaries"))
```

Connecting R to SQL
===

Usual workflow:
- Load the driver, connect to the right database
- R sends an SQL  query to the DBMS
- SQL **executes the query**, sending back a manageably small dataframe
- R does the actual statistics
- Close the connection when you're done

Going the Other Way
===

- The `sqldf` package lets you use SQL commands on dataframes
- Mostly useful if you already know SQL better than R...


Summary
===

- A database is basically a way of dealing efficiently with lots of potentially huge dataframes
- SQL is the standard language for telling databases what to do, especially what queries to run
- Everything in an SQL query is something we've practiced already in R
    + subsetting/selection, aggregation, merging, ordering
- Connect R to the database, send it an SQL query, analyse the returned dataframe
